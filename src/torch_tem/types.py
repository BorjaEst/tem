"""Core type definitions used across TEM.

This module is intentionally dependency-light (no imports from other
`torch_tem` modules) and provides shared aliases and small dataclasses used
throughout the codebase.

Conventions:
    - Multi-scale codes are `List[Tensor]` (one tensor per frequency module).
    - Many modules use `B` for batch size and `S = sum(shape)` for flattened
      multi-scale size.

Longer background notes live in `docs/foundations.md`.
